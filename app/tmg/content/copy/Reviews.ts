        content: "Paradise in the lap of nature a mere stones throw away from Mumbai. Particularly enthralling was the constellation of fireflies on the window nets that we simply stared at with the lights out… much like Van Gogh’s Starry starry night. Clean spacious place with courteous staff and simple fresh tasty food was an added bonus. A must visit for a relaxed time with friends and family",
