This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Create headers from no parameter
PASS Create headers from undefined parameter
PASS Create headers from empty object
PASS Create headers with null should throw
PASS Create headers with 1 should throw
PASS Create headers with sequence
PASS Create headers with record
PASS Create headers with existing headers
PASS Create headers with existing headers with custom iterator
PASS Check append method
PASS Check set method
PASS Check has method
PASS Check delete method
PASS Check get method
PASS Check keys method
PASS Check values method
PASS Check entries method
PASS Check Symbol.iterator method
PASS Check forEach method
FAIL Iteration skips elements removed while iterating assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["bar", "baz"] length 2, got ["bar", "baz", "foo"] length 3
FAIL Removing elements already iterated over causes an element to be skipped during iteration assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["bar", "baz", "quux"] length 3, got ["bar", "baz", "foo", "quux"] length 4
FAIL Appending a value pair during iteration causes it to be reached during iteration assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["bar", "baz", "foo", "quux", "x-yz"] length 5, got ["bar", "baz", "foo", "quux"] length 4
FAIL Prepending a value pair before the current element position causes it to be skipped during iteration and adds the current element a second time assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["bar", "baz", "baz", "foo", "quux"] length 5, got ["bar", "baz", "foo", "quux"] length 4
Harness: the test ran to completion.
